// snap every animated object onto its destination because a frame would need

//
// The ordering rule: before an event with timestamp T is applied, springs step to
// T toward the destinations that were in effect before T, so a new destination
// starts pulling within 4 ms of T at any frame rate. chenguini's ui.md orders a
// frame as handle inputs, new layout, animation tick, so a frame's catch-up steps
// all pull toward the new destination, starting from up to one frame plus 4 ms
// before the event, and an animation from rest starts at the frame's timestamp,
// up to one frame after the event. Both depend on the frame rate.
//
// Settling is checked only by 'settle check' evaluations, at simulated times
// checkOriginMs + 64 k ms by default, and by an evaluation while the clock is
// stopped, which starts the clock at its own time. A settle check at simulated
// time c runs before events with timestamps at or after c, so every frame rate
// checks the same state against the same destinations.
//
// Static bounds, and what happens past them:
// - A frame's evaluations run at most maxStepsPerFrame steps together, 300 by
//   default. Before each 'events' or 'frame' evaluation, when stepping to its time
//   would run more steps than what's left of that budget, a 'snap' evaluation first
//   snaps every animated object onto its destination with zero velocity and stops
//   the clock, which drops the backlog, and the evaluation then runs with the
//   clock stopped. E.g. the first frame after a 2 s stall shows every object at
//   its destination. An event during such a stall still applies at its own
//   timestamp, after springs snap onto the destinations in effect before it, so
//   its animation starts at its timestamp. When stepping from the event to the
//   next evaluation runs past what's left of the budget, springs snap again, onto
//   the event's destinations.
// - The steps count from animatedUntilMs, where springs last stepped in state that
//   was written back. With 'every evaluation', that's less than 4 ms before the
//   previous frame, so a frame gap of at most 1,200 ms never snaps. With 'events
//   and settle checks', a frame evaluates a copy, so the steps count from the last
//   event or settle check, which is less than 64 ms before the previous frame, and
//   a frame gap from just above 1,140 ms can snap, depending on where the last
//   settle check landed. So whether a snap runs can differ across frame rates, and
//   so can the stored state after it.
// - An event with a timestamp before the last evaluation that wrote state back is
//   applied at that evaluation's time, and one after the frame's timestamp at the frame's.
